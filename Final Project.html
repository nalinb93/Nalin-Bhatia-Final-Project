<h2>Checklist</h2>

<img src="Checklist.png" alt="Accessibility Checklist">


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The contrast ratio between the text and its background is 1.5:1 which is much less than the required 3:1.
    Therefore, I recommend choosing a darker background color to increase the contrast ratio.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Similarly, when you sctoll down under the 'Featured Events' heading, there is a grey patch under every image. On the second and third image's grey patches, there is a botton link - 'RSVP here'. Now, the contrast ratio between the text and its background is 1.55:1 which is again much less than the required 4.5:1 for that size of a text.
      Therefore, I recommend choosing a lighter font color to increase the contrast ratio and make the links more visible.</li>
      <br>
    <li>When scrolling down, there is a quick links section with link - Lost & Found, Building Search,....Chat with us.
    As per the second check point, these links are important information, but there is no additional indicators like
  icons or underline in addition to the black text color and grey hover background color for those links.</li>
  <br>
      <li>After scrolling down, there are three image links with caption – Campus Map, Victor Views Block and Happening@Michigan. The first image has a map as its image with a yellowish hue. The background color of the caption ‘Campus Map’ is also of the same hue (yellow) but different value.
        Therefore, I recommend making the map color of a different hue to increase the contrast. </li>
        <br>
    <li>The third image with caption - Happening@Michigan  gives a Wave Validation error – ‘After 1 X Suspicious alternative text’. Therefore, I recommend using a more appropriate alternative text for the image used.</li>
